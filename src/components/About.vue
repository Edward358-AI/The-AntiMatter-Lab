        <h1>About</h1><br>
        <p>This project was created originally in the summer of 2024 as a passion project to give the world a better understanding of what physics really is (it was also originally designed to get more people to join a local physics club). Physics is not an easy concept to grasp, and this project was aimed to target those areas where current resources were lacking. The website design and programming was done by Edward Jiang, and the curriculum/teachings were carefully crafted by multiple-time USAPHO qualifier Eric Niu. Our aim continues to be to make physics accessible, because we believe gaining a better understanding physics allows you to gain a better understanding of yourself and the world around you.</p><br><br>
        
        <h1>Need Help?</h1><br>
        <p>If you just opened up this website or you're simply stuck on where to start, we recommend starting from the first lesson, unless you have something specific that you are looking for. Then you can use our handy search bar to find the exact lesson you want. The key difference between this and other physics tutorials out there is that this is built to cover three different levels of physics, which makes it suitable for all ages and all kinds of people. If you just want to learn physics to indulge yourself in the science, you can start with our conceptual level. If you have an algebra foundation and maybe are even prepping for the APÂ® Physics 1/2 exam, we have an algebra-based level just for you. If you are extremely advanced and you know calculus, you can experience physics at its maximum with our calculus-based version. We have interactive examples and not just wordy explanations, which overall can greatly improve your learning experience. Enjoy!</p><br><br>

        <h1>Technicalities</h1><br>
        <p>This project was built using HTML, CSS and JS. The use of VueJS (<a href="https://vuejs.org" target="_blank">https://vuejs.org</a>) was incorporated to allow dynamic rendering and much easier implementation of certain functionalities over regular JS. A CSS framework, Halfmoon CSS (<a href="https://www.gethalfmoon.com" target="_blank">https://www.gethalfmoon.com</a>), was also used to effortlessly create a (somewhat) nice looking layout and website. Vite (<a href="https://vitejs.dev" target="_blank">https://vitejs.dev</a>) was used during the development phase for convenience and is included in the production build as well.</p><br><br>

        <h1>Contact</h1><br>
        <p>If you have any questions, about physics or not, you can contact Edward via discord (edward.jiang_) or email (<a href="mailto:edward456jiang@gmail.com" target="_blank">edward456jiang@gmail.com</a>). If the question is physics related, you are much better off asking Eric (discord: antimatter162, email: <a href="mailto:antimatter5175@gmail.com" target="_blank">antimatter5175@gmail.com</a>).</p><br><br>
