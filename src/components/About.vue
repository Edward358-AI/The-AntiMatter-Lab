        <h1>About</h1><br>
        <p>This project was created originally in the summer of 2024 as a passion project to give the world a better
            understanding of what physics really is (it was also originally designed to get more people to join a local
            physics club). Physics is not an easy concept to grasp, and this project was aimed to target those areas
            where current resources were lacking. The website design and programming was done by Edward Jiang, and the
            curriculum/teachings were carefully crafted by multiple-time USAPHO qualifier Eric Niu. Our aim continues to
            be to make physics accessible, because we believe gaining a better understanding physics allows you to gain
            a better understanding of yourself and the world around you.<br>This project is currently tending to lack in
            practice problems, you can find practice problems in this textbook, which also provides pretty good examples
            and demonstrations as well: <a class="link-underline-secondary"

        <h1>Need Help?</h1><br>
        <p>If you just opened up this website or you're simply stuck on where to start, we recommend starting from the
            first lesson, unless you have something specific that you are looking for. Then you can use our handy search
            bar to find the exact lesson you want. The key difference between this and other physics tutorials out there
            is that this is built to cover three different levels of physics, which makes it suitable for all ages and
            all kinds of people.<br><br>
            <span><strong>Conceptual:</strong> Simple as possible, avoiding using complex mathematical
                calculations/representations when possible. Prior experience using basic algebra is recommended, but not
                required. If you're brave, you could jump right in! However, it could a little more difficult to
                understand, however, if you don't have that background. If you don't, don't worry! Simple go to this
                link: <a class="link-underline-secondary"
                    href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-basics/alg-basics-algebraic-expressions"
                    target="_blank">https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-basics/alg-basics-algebraic-expressions</a>
                and finish the whole thing, and then come back and start learning!</span><br>
            <br><br>
            <span><strong>Algebra-Based:</strong> Takes it up a notch by using algebra-level skills, which introduces a
                lot of new things like equations and graphs. Knowledge of Algebra 1 and Geometry is required, although
                we very strongly recommend studying Algebra 2 (either previously taken or concurrently learning) as it
                will make learning orders of magnitude easier.</span><br>
            <br><br>
            <span><strong>Calculus-Based:</strong> The purest form of physics, which expands on algebra-based physics
                with calculus concepts. Concurrent learning or previously taken APÂ® Calculus AB (or of similar material)
                is required for sufficient understanding.</span><br><br>
            <br>
            We also have interactive examples and not just wordy explanations, which overall can greatly improve
            your learning experience. We've also sprinkled in a bit of light humor when I (Eric) deemed it necessary.
            Enjoy! <br>Note: Sometimes when you switch the difficulty, the content on a page may not change.
            This is because some content may be overlapping (i.e. the content is the same regardless of what math
            level).

        <h1>Technicalities</h1><br>
        <p>This project was built using HTML, CSS and JS.<br>The use of VueJS (<a class="link-underline-secondary"
                href="https://vuejs.org" target="_blank">https://vuejs.org</a>) was incorporated to allow dynamic
            rendering and much easier
            implementation of certain functionalities over regular JS.<br>A CSS framework, Halfmoon CSS (<a
                class="link-underline-secondary" href="https://www.gethalfmoon.com"
                target="_blank">https://www.gethalfmoon.com</a>), was also used to
            effortlessly create a (somewhat) nice looking layout and website.<br>MathJax (<a
                class="link-underline-secondary" href="https://mathjax.org" target="_blank">https://mathjax.org</a>) and
            Vue-MathJax-Next (<a class="link-underline-secondary" href="https://github.com/justforuse/vue-mathjax-next"
                target="_blank">https://github.com/justforuse/vue-mathjax-next</a>) were implemented for clean looking
            equations and math symbols.<br>Vite (<a class="link-underline-secondary" href="https://vitejs.dev"
                target="_blank">https://vitejs.dev</a>) was used during the development phase for convenience and is
            included in the production build as well.</p><br><br>

        <h1>Contact</h1><br>
        <p>If you have any questions, about physics or not, you can contact Edward via discord (edward.jiang_) or email
            (<a class="link-underline-secondary" href="mailto:edward456jiang@gmail.com"
                target="_blank">edward456jiang@gmail.com</a>). If the question is
            physics related, you are most likely much better off asking Eric (discord: antimatter162, email: <a
