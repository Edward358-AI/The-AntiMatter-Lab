        <h1>Relative Velocity (and reference frames)</h1><br>
        <div v-show="page === 0">
            <p>
                Relative velocity will be a rather short lesson, as there are mostly just concepts that we need to go
                over.<br><br>In actuality, it is not a huge topic to tackle. The easiest way to teach this is by
                example. A common example used is a person in a train and an onlooker at a station or the side of the
                tracks. To someone else in the train with me, it does not look like I am moving. However, to the
                onlooker on the outside, I am zooming past them. Why is this? Well, the key here is the idea of a
                reference frame.<br><br>A <i>reference frame</i> is nothing too complex, it is exactly what it sounds
                like. It
                is a frame in which you conduct your calculations and view everything happen. The key thing here is
                though, a reference frame could be inertial or non inertial. Pretty much all of the reference frames we
                work inside will always be inertial, unless otherwise stated.
                <br><br>
                Noninertial reference frames don't serve a
                purpose until much laterâ€”so don't worry too much about them for now. We will soon explain why we prefer
                inertial reference frames! For now, just understand the concept of it, since reference frames will come
                up again later on!!
                <br><br>So for someone in the
                train, since they are moving at the same velocity I am, they don't see me move <i>relative to their
                    point of view</i>. The same applies to the observer, since he is not moving, while I am, it looks to
                him as if I am moving.
                <br><br>
                Let's say I wanted to find what my velocity was relative to the observer. From
                that we can derive an equation:
                <br><br>
                $$\vec{v_{PO}}=\vec{v_{PT}}+\vec{v_{TO}}$$
                <br>The subscripts and symbols
                might be a bit confusing at first, but essentially what they mean is that my velocity relative to the
                observer ($v_{PO}$) is equal to the <i>vector</i> sum of my velocity relative to the train ($v_{PT}$)
                and the velocity of the train relative to the observer ($v_{TO}$). We notice that this is a vector sum,
                which means it works in multiple dimensions.
                <br><br>
                Furthermore, you might see that the middle two subscripts
                are equal. That means to find the velocity of A relative to B, we can find the relative velocity of A to
                another point C, and the velocity of C relative to point B. Adding those will actually give us the
                velocity of A, relative to B! That's how vectors work to help us. Let's work through a minimal example
                on the next page.

            <div class="problem">
                <i>A boat is traveling North at a speed of $12~\textrm m /\textrm s$ across a river with a current
                    flowing
                    East at a speed of $5~\textrm m /\textrm s$. What is the boat's velocity relative to an observer on
                    the
                    Southern shore in component form? Assume North and East are the positive directions.</i><br><br>
                Perhaps a diagram will help us solve this problem:
                <br><br>
                <figure>
                    <img src="/src/assets/kinematics/Figure 14.png" />
                    <figcaption>Figure 1: A boat traveling across a river, with vectors labeled.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <br>
                Obviously we have the boat and the observer, but we need a third point of reference to go about. There
                are
                many options that we can choose, but we want to make our math as simple as possible. When the boat is
                traveling North, it is also being pushed downstream with the water. Thus from the water's perspective,
                the
                boat is not moving at all (Think back to the train example: To you, someone else on the train isn't
                moving
                because you are both moving at the same speed the train is)!
                <br><br>
                Now let's try and relate the water and the
                observer on the shore. The observer on the shore is not moving, so the water is moving relative to the
                shore. Thus, when we do a vector sum, splitting the two vectors into components (North-South is the
                vertical
                component, East-West is the horizontal component):
                <br><br>$$v_{BO} = v_{BW} + v_{WO}$$ $$\langle v_{BO_x},
                v_{BO_y}
                \rangle = \langle 0,12 \rangle + \langle
                5,0 \rangle=\bbox[3px,
                border: 0.5px solid
                white]{\langle 5,12 \rangle}$$
                <br>
                The boat's velocity relative to the water only has a vertical component, Northbound at $12~\textrm m
                /\textrm s$. That's why its horizontal component is zero. Relative to the observer on the shore, the
                water
                is moving East with a speed of $5~\textrm m /\textrm s$, and not moving North or South. That's why its
                vertical component is zero.
                <span v-show="level > 0">Since we know how to find the magnitude, we can do this relatively easily using
                    Pythagorean theorem:
                    <br><br>
                    $$|v_{BO}|=\sqrt{(5)^2+(12)^2}=\bbox[3px,
                    border: 0.5px solid
                    white]{13~\textrm m /\textrm s}$$
                    <br></span>
            </div>
            <br>
            Sometimes, it may be easier to shorthand the equation like so, especially when $C$ is not needed:
            <br><br>$$v_{AB} = v_A-v_B$$<br>
            And vice versa. Essentially, what this equation states is that the velocity of A relative to B is the
            velocity of A minus the velocity of B. However use this only when the velocity of A and B are given to be
            relative to the same reference frame C.

            whole world of physics awaits! You have only scratched the surface of it. Next unit is probably the one of
            the most important, if not THE most important lesson in all of Newtonian mechanics. Onwards!
