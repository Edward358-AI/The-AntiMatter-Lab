        <h1>Dimensional Analysis</h1><br>
        <p>
            <span v-show="level == 0">Hopefully the lesson on vectors taught you much. Now this is going to be a relatively short lesson that explains a few concepts that are going to be important for the rest of physics. Assuming you have been taught something similar or taken a science class that has utilized this, you may simply skip over this lesson. However, if you haven't learned this before, this is going to be interesting for you.<br>Before we get into what dimensional analysis is, we must understand what we're dealing with here. If you look at the two words separately, you get "Dimensional" and "Analysis". The first important thing about dimensional analysis is the dimensions part.<br>A dimension, is much like maybe what you see as a unit. If you've ever measured something, you know that you need to specify what units it is in. For example, if you measure length, you might use centimeters or inches, and if you're measuring volume, you might use liters, or gallons. These are all examples of dimensions, and they give meaning to a number. What do we mean by this? Take the number $6$, for example. While it might be useful in your math class or your everyday arithmetic, in the world of science, it is utterly <i>useless!</i> (well, not utterly, but you get the idea). The reason why I say this is because it could mean $6$ meters, $6$ seconds, $6$ meters/second, $6$ Newtons, $6$ Newton meters, and so on. See, without a unit, a simple "number" becomes practically meaningless, so that's why we stress the importance of units.<br>Another helpful thing to know about this is the concept of derived units. Derived units are units that are usually made through a combination of multiple units. For example, the unit for velocity is meters per second, or $\frac{\textrm{m}}{\textrm{s}}$. What does this mean? This tells you that something is traveling $1$ meter per $1$ second (when I say $1$, even though there isn't any place that explicitly puts a "$1$" in front of the $\textrm{m}$ and the $\textrm{s}$, it is implied, because $1$ multiplied by anything is just itself). Another derived unit is the <i>Newton</i>, or <i>N</i>, and its derived form is this: $\frac{\textrm{kg} \cdot \textrm{m}}{\textrm{s}^2}$. Whew! That's a lot of units, right? If you break it down, though, it becomes more apparent. You'll learn this later on, but since Newtons is the unit to measure <i>force</i>, it tells you that $1$ Newton is the force needed to give a mass of $1 ~ \textrm{kg}$ with an acceleration of $1 \frac{\textrm{m}}{\textrm{s}^2}$! Isn't that cool?<br>The second part is analysis. We won't focus too much on the analysis part, since that requires some more advanced mathematical knowledge. Regardless, it is important to understand that in physics, the unit gives meaning to a number. Throughout lessons, we will introduce to you units and derived units, which are all important to know. Are you ready for some "real" physics now? Then let's get going!</span>

Isn't that cool?<br>The second part is analysis. Analysis is a bit more interesting. When you do analysis, you are basically doing math that requires converting or changing units. For example, you might need to do dimensional analysis to convert units, or because you're solving an equation. This is the algebra-based version, so we assume you know anything divided by itself is equal to one. The same goes for units. So if we want to convert $1 ~ \textrm{L}$ to $\textrm{mL}$, and we know $1 ~ \textrm{L} = 1000 ~ \textrm{mL}$, we can do something like this: $$1 ~ \cancel{\textrm{L}} ~ \cdot ~ 1000 ~ \frac{\textrm{mL}}{\cancel{\textrm{L}}}$$ You notice how units are able to cancel out, just like you would do with variables or numbers!<br>Now let's see this in an equation. A simple equation you may already know is $\textrm{speed} \cdot \textrm{time} = \textrm{distance}$. Speed is measured in $\frac{\textrm{meters}}{\textrm{second}}$, and time is measured in $\textrm{seconds}$. Thus, let's use some arbitrary numbers and see it in action! $$3 ~ \frac{\textrm{m}}{\cancel{\textrm{s}}} ~ \cdot ~  9 ~ \cancel{\textrm{s}} = 27 ~ \textrm{m}$$ Do we see how this works? Hopefully you understand how to do math with units now! As you get more and more familiar or experienced with the math being done, you can simply omit the units for the sake of time and space. However, when just starting out, which we assume you are, we highly recommend adding units, because it gives you an idea of how varying units can work together to produce a different unit as a result.<br>As you can see, it is important to understand that in physics, the unit gives meaning to a number. Throughout lessons, we will introduce to you many different units and derived units, which are all important to know. Are you ready for some "real" physics now? Then let's get going!</span>
