## About
This project was created originally in the summer of 2024 as a passion project to give the world a better understanding of what physics really is (it was also originally designed to get more people to join a local physics club). Physics is not an easy concept to grasp, and this project was aimed to target those areas where current resources were lacking. The website design and programming was done by Edward Jiang, and the curriculum/teachings were carefully crafted by multiple-time USAPHO qualifier Eric Niu. Our aim continues to be to make physics accessible, because we believe gaining a better understanding physics allows you to gain a better understanding of yourself and the world around you.

## Building and Running
If you want to build/run a local copy of this project yourself, you can run the following commands below:
```
git clone https://github.com/Edward358-AI/The-AntiMatter-Lab.git
cd The-AntiMatter-Lab
npm install
```
Check `package.json` for the three deployment scripts and run the corresponding one that you want to run using `npm run <script>`

Make sure you have `npm` installed before running any of these scripts.

## Contact
If you have any questions, about physics or not, you can contact Edward via discord (edward.jiang_) or email (edward456jiang@gmail.com). If the question is physics related, you are much better off asking Eric (discord: antimatter162, email: antimatter5175@gmail.com).
